# 📂 Dataset Description

## 📌 Dataset Title:
**Thyroid Ultrasound Image Segmentation Dataset**

## 🔗 Source:
[Kaggle Dataset - Thyroid Ultrasound](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eiraoi/thyroidultrasound)

## 📁 Dataset Overview:
This dataset consists of **ultrasound images of the thyroid gland** along with corresponding **segmentation masks** indicating the regions of interest (typically nodules).

- **Total Samples:** 637 images  
- **Image Dimensions:** 256 × 256 pixels  
- **Shape:**  
  - Images: `(637, 256, 256)`  
  - Masks: `(637, 256, 256)`  

## 📊 Data Format:
- Grayscale ultrasound images (likely `.png` or `.jpeg`)
- Binary masks indicating lesion regions
- Organized into two separate directories:  
  - `/images`  
  - `/masks`

## 📚 Use Case:
Ideal for training and evaluating deep learning models for **medical image segmentation**, particularly for **thyroid nodule detection**.

## ⚠️ Notes:
- Preprocessing may be required (normalization, resizing, etc.) depending on the network architecture used.
- Ensure matching between image and mask filenames for accurate supervision during training.
